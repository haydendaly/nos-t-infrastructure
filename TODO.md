# To-Do

These are remaining tasks I have semi-ordered by priority.
1. Add documentation/checklist for building components for the system.
2. Scaled realtime -> no synchronization algorithm
    - Start time
    - Running speed
    - End time
    - Timer running
3. Propogation with Orekit (or AstroPy and Skyfield).
4. Auto-generate docker-compose based off component script. Maybe create a `.yml` to specify connections and other system info.
5. Add localized resources for nodes of the system like graphs of observations -> would have to add Flask endpoints to components and perform GET on control frontend.
