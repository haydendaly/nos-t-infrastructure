# To-Do

These are remaining tasks I have semi-ordered by priority.
1. Add schema documentation on README.md or DOCUMENTATION.md specifying SensorThings API and how current schema is derived from it.
2. Form presentation based around the component interface for the system (potentially form boilerplate component).
3. Add initialization / component information on control before start sequence (maybe add topic/runtime).
4. Add startup options as form potentially.
5. Add localized resources for nodes of the system like graphs of observations -> would have to add Flask endpoints to components and perform GET on control frontend.
6. Build a Node.js example component.
7. Auto-generate docker-compose based off component script. Maybe create a `.yml` to specify connections and other system info.
